The Voice from on high shouted down with a single, ringing message:

#Voice[You, who do not belong, stand in the way of Our return to Greatness]

#Voice[An insect, discoloring Our marble and gold]

Ashamed of us, the Voice demanded we remain hidden. Demanded we do not deserve to have pride. 

For people like me are no longer people, but living agendas that should be stamped out.

Forced to capitulate, our institutions obeyed.

Living beneath that Voice, i couldn't help to feel powerless. Protesting would be giving them a target to aim at, a neck to wrap their rope around,

But we could still come together.

We were able to hold hands with one another, even if a hand could not be offered in support from above.
