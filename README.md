## What Is This?
In the wake of students using AI to generate the bulk of their written work for most (if not *all*) of their classes, I have decided that it would be good to begin a paper-trail of my writing process. This way, if there are ever concerns raised about the authenticity of something I have written, I can direct them to the history of this git-repository to hopefully put those concerns to rest.

## What tools do you use?
I write in plain-text .org files using [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/), with [harper](https://writewithharper.com/) as grammer and spell-check and [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (exported as bibtext for use with the emacs org-cite plugin) as my citation manager. I export to PDFs using [typst](https://typst.app/), and to other formats with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). 

I also use [obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a personal knowledge management tool.

I do not use AI with any of the above tools.

## How To View Git-History?

You can view all of the changes to this repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/bluerosegarden/Academic-Corpus/commits/main). You can also view changes made to a specific file by clicking on the 'History' button on the top-right of a file. 

## Why host on github?
Honestly, just to make it easier for people who are un-familiar with git! I would like to eventually move to sr.ht for my other projects one day, but this will probably always remain here for that reason. 

Feel free to email me at [mail@bluerose.garden](mailto:mail@bluerose.garden) if you have any questions or concerns!
