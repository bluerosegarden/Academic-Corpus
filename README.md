## What Is This?
In the wake of students using AI to generate the bulk of their written work for most (if not *all*) of their classes, I have decided that it would be good to begin a paper-trail of my writing process. This way, if there are ever concerns raised about the authenticity of something I have written, I can direct them to the history of this git-repository to hopefully put those concerns to rest.

## What tools do you use?
I write in plain-text .org files using [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/), with [harper](https://writewithharper.com/) as grammer and spell-check and [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (exported as bibtext for use with the emacs org-cite plugin) as my citation manager. I export to PDFs using [typst](https://typst.app/), and to other formats with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). 

I also use [obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a personal knowledge management tool.

I do not use AI with any of the above tools.

Feel free to email me at [mail@bluerose.garden](mailto:mail@bluerose.garden) if you have any questions or concerns!
